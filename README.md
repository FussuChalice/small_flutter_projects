# üóÉÔ∏è Small Flutter Projects

Welcome to the "Small Flutter Projects" repository! This repository is a collection of small, self-contained Flutter projects that serve as examples and learning materials for Flutter developers. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice your Flutter skills or an experienced developer exploring new concepts, these projects are designed to be concise and educational.

## Introduction

Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. "Small Flutter Projects" is a repository created to provide small, focused Flutter projects that cover various aspects of Flutter development. Each project is kept simple to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

## Projects

| Project name | Description|
|--------------|------------|
| [flutter_bloc_counter](./flutter_bloc_counter/) | is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates the use of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture for state management. In this project, a counter app is implemented using the BLoC pattern, separating the UI from the business logic and state management. |
